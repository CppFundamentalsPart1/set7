results with if statement:
    real    0m0.249s
    user    0m0.245s
    sys     0m0.004s

results without if statement:
    real    0m2.406s
    user    0m2.398s
    sys     0m0.001s

So without the if statement the execution time is almost tenfold. This can be attributed to the insertions: since not every insertion check's the state of out it won't always realise it can't print before any insertions occur. On the other hand checking a flag is simple and prevents unnecessary insertions.

Rule of thumb: If a direct test is available it should be used.
