Explain how you created the library, how you linked it to the program

    The library is created by compiling the library sources as normal and then creating the library using the command:
        $ ar rvs ../build/54/lib/liblockutil.a ../build/54/lib/lock/valid.o ../build/54/lib/lock/lock1.o ../build/54/lib/lock/lock2.o ../build/54/lib/lock/lock3.o ../build/54/lib/lock/lockpath.o ../build/54/lib/lock/open.o ../build/54/lib/lock/stringname.o

    It is then linked to the program using the command:
        $ g++ ../build/54/main.o -o ../build/54/a.out -L ../build/54/lib/ -llockutil

Show that your directory organization has a separate directory for the development of the library.

    the sources are organized as normal:
        54
        ├── main.cpp
        └── lock
           ├── lock.ih
           ├── lock.h
           ├── valid.cpp
           ├── stringname.cpp
           ├── open.cpp
           ├── lockpath.cpp
           ├── lock3.cpp
           ├── lock2.cpp
           └── lock1.cpp

    But the library files are placed in their own directory when compiling:
        build/54
        ├── a.out
        ├── main.o
        └── lib
           ├── liblockutil.a
           └── lock
              ├── valid.o
              ├── stringname.o
              ├── open.o
              ├── lockpath.o
              ├── lock3.o
              ├── lock2.o
              └── lock1.o
