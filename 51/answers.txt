After extracting the first number the stringstream reaches the end of its buffer and sets the eof flag. When we assign a new value to the buffer this flag is not cleared, hence the second extraction fails. We must first clear the flags (using istr.clear()) before we can read from it again.

The required repair is:

    istr >> no1;

    cout << "extracted first number: " << no1 << '\n';

    istr.clear();
    istr.str(argv[2]);
